As they watched a horde of zombies destroy the huge demon city Kraval, the dark elves were tantalized by the devastating power of uncontrolled zombies, and desired to control and increase it. When they wove their dominating magic into a few captive zombies something went horribly wrong!\\n\\nThey hadn\"t known the powerful necromancer, Ciglio, had created these zombies. To control his huge armies of undead, Ciglio permanently bound his zombies and their infected victims to him. This binding was so powerful, their loyalty surpassed his untimely death. In the dark elves\" pride and lust, their magic twisted into Ciglio\"s binding, fusing into a new, uncontrollable creation, the Zombasite.\\n\\nZombasite is a nasty, voracious, all-consuming Zombie Parasite. It doesn\"t just reanimate the dead into mindless zombies. It is intelligent, insatiable, and unstoppable---infecting and killing the living, spreading faster and in more ways, helping the dead utilize many of their original skills, and mutating the dead with new powers. Dark elf zombies are terrifying!\\n\\nSo what does this have to do with you? You are the leader of a clan trying to survive the apocalypse. This is easier said than done. When a follower dies, they can\"t be saved by any means. The Zombasite is highly contagious and zombies are quickly ravaging the world\"s surface. Food is a critical resource that must be obtained. Vendors are rare and have limited supplies. Some of the stronger monsters have survived and are as dangerous as ever. Clans of humans and monsters are fighting over what few supplies are left.  Even within your own clan it isn\"t safe. Humans living on the edge are even more unstable than usual. So yeah, survival isn\"t easy."},"GameBlurb2":{"loc":"Orcs were created in an accident long ago when a necromancer tried to raise, thought to be dead, elves and it went very wrong. Instead of creating zombie slaves, the necromancer was ripped to shreads by pissed off orcs. The dormant necromancer magic that remained has always protected orcs from being infected by Zombies. The Zombasite (zombie parasite) is intelligent though and it has finally learned how to break through this magic. Once broken, the infection swept through the entire orc population quickly. Again it went very wrong. Inside of every individual orc there was a war between the orc blood, the Zombasite, and the no longer dormant elven blood.\\n\\nWhen the orc blood won, a Dark Orc rose up. With even less elven influence, Dark Orcs are more aggressive, savage, and stronger than ever.\\n\\nWhen the elven blood won, you got a Mutated. The Mutated are a new unstable orc/elven race. The elven heritage has become the dominate part, but they are still corrupted with orc blood and necromancer magic. This corruption slowly mutates them over time, sometimes in good ways and sometimes in bad ways. No one quite understands the mutated and everyone fears them.\\n\\nAnd finally when the Zombasite won, a Zombie Lord was unleashed. Zombie Lords have full access to the strength of the orcs and intelligence of the elves. They are the most powerful and feared Zombies known.\\n\\nWith three new powerful factions rising up from the ashes of the Orc race, how will you continue to survive the Zombasite?\\n\\nZombasite History\\n\\n$$GameBlurb$$"},"GameBlurbHardcore":{"loc":"During the Orc Schism, the entire Orc race was violently split into Dark Orcs, Zombielords, and the Mutated. The Mutated are tainted with Orc blood, a zombie parasite, and necromancer magic. This makes people seriously mistrust and even fear them.

Who is going to trust you when you grow horns overnight?\\n\\nDespite all of this, the Mutated are actually more closely related to the Elves, both their behavior and physically. They want to prove this to the world, but they are facing a tremendous uphill battle.\\n\\nThe trickster god Din was intrigued by their chaotic mutations and burning desire to prove themselves to the world. Always in need of champions, he made a pact with the Mutated. Each volunteer would become one of his champions trying to save the world wherever Din sends them. In return, each time they die in his service he resurrects them to continue their service.\\n\\nDin\"s Legacy, as well as the Mutated\"s and yours, are all in your hands!
